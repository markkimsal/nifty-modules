What is remotewebdav?
================================================================================
This modules allows limited access to your cognifty installation via the WebDAV 
protocol.  Although the access is limited, you can still access all the 
functionality you need to customize any part of a running system.

  Make backups of your configuration files.
  Make changes to your configuration files.
  Make template changes. (add new CSS/images)
  Install new modules.
  Override existing modules with your customizations.
  Backup module code.

The only thing you can't do that you might need to do on a regular basis is 
download a datbase backup.  Also, you can't access or clear the cache.
 

Installation
================================================================================
Move the folder "remotewebdav" into your local-admin folder.

For cognifty r18 and below:

	Add the following to boot/local/default.ini
	  [path]
	  override.admin.remotewebdav=@sys.path@/local-admin/remotewebdav

	Add the following to boot/admin/admin.ini
	  [path]
	  override.module.remotewebdav=@sys.path@/local-admin/remotewebdav

For cognifty r19 and above:
	Add the following to boot/local/default.ini
	  [path]
	  override.admin.remotewebdav=@sys.path@/local-admin/remotewebdav
